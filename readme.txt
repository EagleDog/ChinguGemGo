The sacred Chingu Gem has been lost in the sands
of time. But who can help to recover such a rare
and special artifact?

One day, Melchior the Cat was scratching around
in the sand, when he found the elusive Chingu Gem.
But its powers had been drained by the Evil Forces
of Deprecation.

Many great video games were rendered inoperable
with the loss of the Easy Gamestate Management
provided by the Mighty Chingu Gem.

Now it is up to Melchior the Cat to restore the
powers of the Chingu Gem, or else humanity will
be doomed. The entire Multiverse will explode if
the Chingu Gem's powers cannot be restore.

Who will join the quest?...
